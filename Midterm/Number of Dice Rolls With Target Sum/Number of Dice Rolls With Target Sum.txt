Description
You have n dice and each die has k faces numbered from 1 to k.
Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the k^n total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equalstarget.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7


Input
The first line contains two numbers n and k,respectively.
The second line contains a numbertarget.

Constraints:
1≤n,k≤30
1≤target≤1000


Output
Print the number of possible ways to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up number equalstarget.
