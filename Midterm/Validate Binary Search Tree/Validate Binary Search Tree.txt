Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


Input
The nodes of tree is given in the breadth first order.

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1,10^4].
−2^31≤Node.val≤2^31−1


Output
If the tree is an BST, returntrue; otherwise, returnfalse.

Sample Output 1
true
