Description
A good sequence G (G0, G1, ..., G(N−1)) is a sequence that meets at least one of the three requirements below:
The length of the sequence N≤2
The first half of the sequence is a good sequence, and all the elements in the second half are equal to each other; that is, G0, G1, ... , G ⌊(N−1)/2⌋ is a good sequence and Gi=Gj for ⌊(N−1)/2⌋≤i,j≤N−1.
All the elements in the first half of the sequence are equal to each other, and the second half is a good sequence; that is, Gi=Gj for 0≤i,j≤⌊(N−1)/2⌋ and G ⌊(N−1)/2⌋, G ⌊(N−1)/2⌋+1, ... , G(N-1) is a good sequence.

Given a sequence a, you are allowed to do the following operations:
Pick an element ai and increase it by 1.
Pick an element ai and decrease it by 1.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations to transform aa into a good sequence.


Input
The first line contains a positive integer N, which is the number of elements in array a. The second line contains N integers a1, a2, ... ,an, which are the elements of array a.

Constraints:
1≤N≤2×10^6
−10^9≤ai≤10^9
 

Output
Output an integer, which is the minimum number of operations to transform array aa into a good sequence.
