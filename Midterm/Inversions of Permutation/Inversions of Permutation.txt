Description
An inversion (i, j) is a pair of a permutation (s1, s2, s3, …, sn) that satisfies i<j and si>sj.
For example, the permutation (3,2,1) has three inversions (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3). Given a permutation, find the number of inversions of it.


Input
There will be several cases.
Each case contains two lines. The first line contains one integer n, indicating the length of a permutation of the set {1,2,3,…,n}. The second line contains nn integers that form the permutation.
The input ends with an EOF.
