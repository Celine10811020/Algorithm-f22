Description
In nature, there exists a food chain in which a predator preys on at most two species. As the population of a species increases, the natural enemies of the species are gradually afraid of preying on the species. If the population of a species is more than that of its natural enemies, the natural enemies will give up to prey on them. We say that is a strange situation.
Given the food chain with the id of each species and the population of each species, can you calculate the number of strange situations that occurred?
Note that the food chain is presented in the post-order and in-order representations, respectively.


Input
The first line gives an integer N as the number of species in the food chain.
The second line gives N integers a1, a2, aN, ⋯, aN, with ai being the population of the species and i the id of the species.
The third line gives N integers as the in-order representation of the food chain.
The fourth line gives N integers as the post-order representation of the food chain.

Constraints:
1≤N≤2×10^6
1≤ai≤10^9 ∀i∈[1,N]
Both in-order and post-order representations are permutations of 1 to N, and it is guaranteed that the hierarchy could be constructed from the two representations.


Output
Print the number of the strange situations that occurred.
