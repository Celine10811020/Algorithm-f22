Description
There is a new fighting game being published. You have to fight with your enemies continually. You can advance to the next level or the next two levels if you defeat enemies on a level.
For example, if you beat the enemies on level 1010, you can go to either level 11 or level 12.
In order to beat enemies, you have to consume energy. Each level consumes a different amount of energy. Calculate the minimum amount of energy required to pass all the levels.


Input
The first line contains a number N, indicating the number of levels.
The second line gives N integers e1, e2, ⋯, eN, being the energy that needs to be consumed on level 11 to level N respectively.

Constraints:
1≤N≤25000
0≤ei≤10000 ∀i∈[1,N]


Output
Output the minimum amount of energy required to pass all the levels.
