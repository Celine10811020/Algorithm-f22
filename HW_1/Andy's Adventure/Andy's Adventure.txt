Description

Once upon a time, the brilliant archaeologist Andy and his team went on a treasure hunt to the Cajaboole Islands. After months of hunting, the team finally got to the location that was marked a red X on the map. Instead of discovering a treasure chest, an ancient stele came into sight. There was a poem carved into it which says,
Find four stones,
among those buried in the bones.
Sum up the weights,
matching T with no clone,
the path to the treasure will be shown.
Simply put, if you can find four stones that weigh T in total, you are granted access to the treasure. Now you have k stones, which weights w1, w2, ... , wk, respectively. As a smart programmer, can you help the team find out the total number of unique combinations of stones that match the statement? If there is no possible combination, outputFeiDooDoo_Zuo_Wei_Men.
Note that the two combinations are consider different if and only if there exists at least one element with different weights. For example (0, 1, -1, 3) and (1, 3, 0, -1) are consider the same combination.


Input
The first line contains two integers N, T, where N is the total number of stones Andy's team have and T is the target that you are going to make.
The next line contains N integers w1, w2, ... , wk, indicating the weight of each stone.

Constraints:
4≤n≤300
-10^9≤T≤10^9
-10^9≤wi≤10^9

Output
Please print the total number of the possible combinations, if there is no possible combination then print FeiDooDoo_Zuo_Wei_Men as shown in the description.
