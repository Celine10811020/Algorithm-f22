There is a price ceiling Pi for each item i (1≤i≤n); that is, the price of the i-th item should not greater than Pi.
The price of each item should be a unique integer from 1 to n.

Input
The first line contains an integer n, which is the number of items in the store.
The second line contains n integers P1, P2, ... Pn, where Pi is the price ceiling of the i-th item.

Constraints:
1≤n≤2×10^5
1≤Pi≤10^9


Output
Print the total number of permutations that the store manager can price the items.
Since the answer might be large, output the answer mod 10^9 + 7
