Description

Everyone dreams of making money, but although making money and having a steady income is fun, paying taxes is not fun. We live in a country (or a region 😏, based on your political preference) that adopts a progressive tax system, where the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases.
The table below shows the tax rate ranges (tax brackets) in Taiwan:

綜合所得淨額		乘法	稅率
0~540,000		x	5%
540,001~1,210,000	x	12%
1,210,001~2,420,000	x	20%
2,420,001~4,530,000	x	30%
4,530,001~以上		x	40%

From National Taxation Bureau of Taipei, Ministry of Taiwan
The first column indicates the taxable income, where the third column shows the tax rates of the respective income range. For example, if you have a total income of NTD\$600,000, then you'll have to pay $540,000 x 5% + ($600,000 - $540,000) x 12% = $34,200 in total.
Given the tax brackets of a country, can you calculate how much tax a person should pay according to one's income?


Input
On the first line there is an integer N, indicating how many ranges there are.
N lines follow, on each line there are two numbers ai & ri, where ai is an integer indicating the least value of this range and ri is a floating point number indicating the tax rate of this bracket.
On the next line, there is one integer M indicating the number of people.
The next M lines each gives one integer ik, which is the income of the k-th person.

Constraints:
0<N≤10^3
0≤ai<aj≤10^9, ∀i<j
0<ri<rj<1, ∀i<j
0<M≤10^4
0≤ik≤10^9


Output
Print out the amount of tax one should pay according to each income ik.
You should round the answer to two decimal places.
