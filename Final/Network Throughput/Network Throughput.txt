Description
A network G consists of n nodes and m links. Each link directly connects two distinct nodes and can transfer data under a fixed transmission limit (bytes per second). Assuming that the source node and the sink node of G are x and y, find the maximum throughput (number of bytes) of G in a second.


Input
There are several cases.
For each case, the first line contains two integers n and m. Then m lines follow. Each of the m lines contains three nonnegative integers u, v, and c, indicating the transmission limit of the link between node uu and node v is c. After that, there is a single line containing two integers x and y. Nodes are 0-indexed.

The input ends with an EOF.

2≤n≤100
0≤m≤n(n−1)/2


Output
Output the maximum throughput for each case. The output of each test case is followed by a line break, except the last test case. A 32-bit signed integer can represent the output.
