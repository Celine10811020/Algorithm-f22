Description
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths m and n, respectively. You are also given an integer k.
nums1 and nums2 represent the digits of two numbers.
Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two numbers. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.
Output an array of the k digits representing the answer.


Input
The first line contains three integers, m, n, and k. (separated by a space)
The second line contains the m digits of nums1.
The third line contains the n digits of nums2.

Constraints:
1≤500
0≤nums1[i],nums2[i]≤9
1≤k≤n+m


Output
Output the k digits that forms the maximum number of length k from digits of the two numbers.
