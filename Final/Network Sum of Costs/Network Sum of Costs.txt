Description
A network G consists of n nodes and m links. Each link directly connects two distinct nodes and can transfer data at a fixed cost. Let dG(u,v) denote the minimum cost of data transmission between node u and node v, and if u and v are not connected, define dG(u,v)=-1. For a specified node x, find ∑y∈V(G)∖{x}dG(x,y), where V(G) denotes the set of nodes of G.


Input
There are several cases.
For each case, the first line contains two integers n and m. Then m lines follow. Each of the m lines contains three nonnegative integers u, v, and c, indicating the cost of the link between node uu and node v is c. After that, there is a single line containing an integer x. Nodes are 0-indexed.

The input ends with an EOF.

2≤n≤10000
0≤m≤nlog2(n)


Output
Output the answer for each case. The output of each test case is followed by a line break, except the last test case. A 32-bit signed integer can represent the output.
