Description
A network G consists of n nodes and m links. Each link directly connects two distinct nodes and can transfer data at a fixed cost. Find the minimum cost required for a specified node x to broadcast data to the remaining n−1 nodes, assuming each node can send/receive data to/from different nodes at the same time, and if there are multiple data transmissions on a link, the cost is only calculated once.


Input
There are several cases.
For each case, the first line contains two integers n and m. Then m lines follow. Each of the m lines contains three nonnegative integers u, v, and c, indicating the cost of the link between node u and node v is c. After that, there is a single line containing an integer x. Nodes are 0-indexed.

The input ends with an EOF.
2≤n≤500
0≤m≤n(n−1)/2
​

Output
Output the minimum cost for each case. The output of each test case is followed by a line break, except the last test case. If G is disconnected (i.e, there exist two nodes that cannot reach each other), output -1. A 32-bit signed integer can represent the output.
