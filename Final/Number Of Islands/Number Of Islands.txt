Description
Given an mxn 2D binary grid, which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


Input
The first line contains two numbers, m and n.
The successive m lines describe the content of the 2D binary grid, and each line contains n binary digits.

Constraints:
1≤n,m≤300
character is either '0' or '1'


Output
Output the number of islands.
