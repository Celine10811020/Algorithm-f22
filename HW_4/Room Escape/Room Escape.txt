Description
You're locked inside a room and have an hour to escape from it. After the exploration of the room, you find out that there is an electronic code lock beside the door and many number cards and a note in a drawer.
The note says "Arrange them such that they form the largest number". You immediately deduce that the password is the largest number. Hence, unlock the password and escape from the room as soon as possible.
Given a number N, indicating the number of cards. Arrange them into the largest number.


Input
The first line gives an integer N, which is the number of cards.
The second line gives N integers n1, n2, ⋯, nN, with ni being the number on the i-th card.

Constraints:
1≤N≤5000
0≤ni≤1000  ∀i∈[1,N]


Output
Output the largest number that can be arranged with the number cards.
Since the number may be very large, so you need to output a string instead of an integer.
