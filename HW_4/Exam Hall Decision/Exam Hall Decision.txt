Description
A TOEIC test will be held on November 13th. Tens of thousands of people have already applied for the test, but there are only two exam rooms (Exam Room A and Exam Room B). The organizer needs to assign exam rooms to these examinees according to their cost of arriving at Exam Room A or Exam Room B. Each room can accommodate exactly half of the examinees. Can you help the organizer to assign the exam rooms such that the total cost of all examinees are minimal?

Costia indicates the cost of the i-th examinee arriving at Exam Room A.
Costib indicates the cost of the i-th examinee arriving at Exam Room B.

Constraints:
2≤N≤10000
N is an even number.
1≤Costia≤1000  ∀i∈[1,N].
1≤Costib≤1000  ∀i∈[1,N].


Output
Output the minimum total cost of the N examinees.
