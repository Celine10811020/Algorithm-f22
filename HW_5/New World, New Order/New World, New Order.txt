Description
It has been a year since a variant of the Rabies virus started to spread globally. Unlike its original strain, this virus can reprogram human brains and make them behave like zombies. For those who believe in anarchism, their dreams come true. Society was ruined, civilizations collapsed, and everything we are used to became history. Now, this blue planet belongs to the "new humans". There are only two options left for the remaining people: join them or go underground.
All zombies obey Overmind, which is believed to be transformed from patient zero. Overmind has some kind of intelligence. Based on the reconnaissance report yesterday, it seemed most zombies in this area were instructed to leave. There is a fear that these zombies are preparing to demolish the largest human settlement nearby.
Although we currently do not know what Overmind is planning, we should take this chance to construct a solid traffic network so that if something bad happens, we can transfer to another stronghold quickly and safely.
We have limited resources, so we must find a way to connect all our strongholds marked on the map at the minimum cost. However, there is a problem. We do not want our outposts to become the weak points of our network, which means that even if these outposts are being attacked by zombies, we can still transfer between the remaining non-outpost strongholds without any danger.
We know that before this crisis, you were an outstanding student studying at NYCU. Could you apply your knowledge of the graph theory to find a feasible plan for us? We all count on you now.


Input
There will be several cases.
For each case, the first line contains three integers v, e, and w. v is the number of the locations, e is the number of viable connections, and w is the number of the outposts. Then e lines follow. Each of the e lines contains three integers a, b, and c, indicating the expected cost of the path between stronghold aa and stronghold b is c. Finally, there are w lines. Each of the w lines contains an integer i, representing the index of an outpost. Strongholds are 0-indexed. An outpost is a type of stronghold.
The input ends with an EOF.

1≤v≤500
0≤e≤v(v−1)/2
​0≤w≤v


Output
Output the minimum cost for each case. If the mentioned requirement cannot be satisfied, output −1. It is guaranteed that the cost can be represented by a 32-bit signed integer.
